        - label: I am aware, that marq24 is a grumpy old guy, so __it can happen__ that my issue will be closed instantly when essential information is missing (e.g. no debug logs provided, no issue description, no steps to reproduce the issue, etc...).
          required: true
        - label: I know, that any attachment send via eMail reply to a github issue notifications will be __ignored and deleted__ by github automatically. With other words __this will not work__!
          required: true
        - label: I confirm that I have [read & understand the main Integration 'check-list'](https://github.com/marq24/ha-fordpass/discussions/80)
          required: true
        - label: I confirm, that I do not have any other fordpass integration installed/configured (please also check deactivated configurations)
          required: true
        - label: My home assistant version is up to date.
          required: true
        - label: I am using the **latest** version of the integration | See the [release list @github](https://github.com/marq24/ha-fordpass/releases) or in home assistant use the HACS 'Update Information' function to ensure that the **latest** released version of the integration is installed. This HACS function can be accessed via the 3-dot menu on the right side for each integration in the HACS integration list.
          required: true
        - label: I have [checked all issues (incl. the closed ones)](https://github.com/marq24/ha-fordpass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for similar issues in order to avoid reporting a duplicate issue .
          required: true
        - label: I have prepared DEBUG log output | In most of the cases of a technical error/issue or if you miss data, I would have the need to ask for DEBUG log output of the integration. There is a short [tutorial/guide 'How to provide DEBUG log' here](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/main/docs/HA_DEBUG.md). If no debug log is provided, the issue will be closed instantly.
          required: true
        - label: I confirm it's really an issue | In the case that you want to understand the functionality of a certain feature/sensor Please be so kind and make use if the discussion feature of this repo (and do not create an issue) - TIA
        - label: |
            I confirm, that I did not read any of the previous bulletin-points and just checked them all. | I don't wanted to waste my time with details, I don't read or follow any existing instructions. | Instead, I want that the maintainer of this repo will spend time explaining the world to me — that's marq24's job!. | I live by the motto: Better to ask twice, than to think about it once. | It's marq24's own fault that he provides open-source software and is willing to offer free support.
